# Support Matrix

BriefLoop is the public project name during the v0.9 compatibility period.
MABW remains the implementation lineage and compatibility surface. This matrix
continues to list supported CLI/runtime surfaces by their current compatible
names such as `multi-agent-brief`, `briefloop`, `/briefloop`, `/mabw`, and
MABW-080.

Each capability has one of the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Supported** | Actively tested, documented, and considered stable for v1.0. |
| **Experimental** | Functional but may change without notice. Not guaranteed for production. |
| **Interface Only** | Abstract interface exists; no concrete implementation shipped. |
| **CLI-only** | Installs and exposes deterministic CLI commands, but does not include source-clone runtime asset trees. |
| **Source-clone-only** | Requires repository files that are not shipped as Python package data. |
| **Deprecated** | Still present but scheduled for removal. Use the replacement. |
| **Not shipped** | Not included in this distribution surface. |

For control-surface capabilities, **Supported** means deterministic commands,
contracts, and regression tests are present. It does not imply output-quality
validation unless that is stated separately.

Feedback commands structure issues and repair plans for the Orchestrator. They do not automatically edit brief artifacts or execute repair.

Quality gate commands write deterministic gate reports and can block unsafe current-stage continue/finalize decisions. They include material-fact, freshness, target-relevance, and editor-new-fact checks. They do not fetch sources, rewrite briefs, execute repair, or create feedback issues automatically.

Evaluation cases are developer/CI regression checks for control-surface behavior. They do not create workflow artifacts, run subagents, fetch sources, score prose, call an LLM judge, or execute repair.

Provenance commands write a deterministic workspace-local audit/debug graph from existing control files. They do not fetch sources, execute workflow stages, replay the runtime, execute repair, verify semantic truth, or block `finalize` by default.

Audience profile files are workspace-local runtime context. The active run uses the frozen per-run snapshot exposed through handoff; these files are not source evidence, artifact contracts, quality gates, provenance graph nodes, or stage blockers.

Improvement Ledger files are human-governed workspace memory controls. Approved materializable guidance is projected into `improvement/memory.md` and frozen into `output/intermediate/improvement_memory_snapshot.md` during `run`/`start`/`handoff`. The snapshot is taste/audience guidance only; it is not evidence, source material, Claim Ledger input, repair instruction, semantic proof, or an output-quality guarantee.

Control switchboard files are runtime control context. Python surfaces deterministic recommendations and records Orchestrator enable/defer/reject selections; selection is not execution and does not run gates, feedback planning, provenance projection, source discovery, repair, or subagents.

Role topology controls runtime role assignment, not the accountable artifact set.
The default topology lets Scout write both `candidate_claims.json` and
`screened_candidates.json`; strict topology keeps Screener independent. Both
paths still require the Claim Ledger, auditable draft, stage-scoped gate
reports, audit report, event log, archive, and human-triggered delivery. This is
not a speed-improvement claim.

Stage runtime/model provenance is recorded when completion transactions are
called with explicit runtime/model values. It is audit metadata in workflow
state and event log records only; it does not prove output quality, support
strength, or model performance.

Claim Ledger freeze is a deterministic control transaction. Claim Ledger agents
write `claim_drafts.json` without claim IDs; Python assigns deterministic
`CL-####` IDs, writes the canonical `claim_ledger.json`, records freeze
metadata, and requires the frozen ledger before Claim Ledger stage completion.
This controls identity and freezing; it is not semantic proof or automatic claim
deduplication.

Atomic Claim Graph support is experimental. When present,
`atomic_claim_graph.json` is validated as an optional structural decomposition
of frozen Claim Ledger claims; Python checks schema, whole-ledger coverage,
deterministic type consistency, and reader-facing atom/process residue. The
graph is not source evidence, not a reader citation surface, and not support
sufficiency.

Evidence Span Registry support is experimental since the v0.9.3 release.
When present, `evidence_span_registry.json` is validated as an optional span
trace artifact; Python checks schema, source-pack byte binding, raw-excerpt
hashes, optional offsets, archive hash projection, and Source Appendix trace
surfaces. It is not source-support judgment, not a Claim-Support Matrix, not a
support-sufficiency gate, and not a reader citation contract.

Claim-Support Matrix support is experimental since the v0.9.3 release.
When present, `claim_support_matrix.json` is validated as an optional
atom-to-evidence support-record artifact; Python checks schema vocabulary,
Claim Ledger / Atomic Claim Graph / Evidence Span Registry references,
high-materiality atom row coverage, and duplicate atom-span relation rows. A
present valid matrix can project explicit rows into read-only status summaries
and quality-gate findings for unsupported, contradicted, weak, or inferential
support records. Missing matrices remain non-blocking, and invalid matrices are
not consumed for support projection findings. This does not assess semantic
support, create automatic support records, decide release eligibility, or prove
truth.

Semantic Assessment Report support is experimental in the v0.9.4 release.
When present, `semantic_assessment_report.json` is validated as an optional
proposal artifact; Python checks schema, assessor/row provenance,
Claim Ledger / Atomic Claim Graph / Evidence Span Registry references, and
high-materiality `llm_only` adjudication flags. Present valid reports can
project proposal-only Claim-Support Matrix delta candidates and read-only status
counts. Missing reports remain non-blocking, and invalid reports are not
projected. This does not create support truth, write the Claim-Support Matrix,
create adjudication queue items, gate delivery, decide release eligibility, or
prove truth.

ReportSpec / ReportPack registry support is experimental. Product-layer report
contracts can describe report type metadata and required control-spine
preservation, and the CLI can list packaged packs, validate a
`report_spec.yaml`, or create a conservative local-first workspace skeleton
from a packaged pack. This setup path does not run subagents, run gates, render
templates, deliver reports, authorize publication, or provide a
lite/force-deliver path.

Source appendices are reader-facing delivery artifacts generated during finalize from cited Claim Ledger sources. They are not source evidence, semantic proof, runtime state, provenance graphs, or workflow gates.

Fast-rerun fact-layer import is an experimental control transaction. It can
import a complete, clean, archived frozen fact layer into a new runtime run for
downstream rerun inspection. It does not register 080 experiment runs, score
output quality, summarize experiments, or prove semantic truth.
`run --recipe fast-rerun` requires an existing valid
`runtime_manifest.fact_layer_import`; it writes runtime handoff guidance from
Analyst onward and must not synthesize upstream source-discovery, Scout,
Screener, or Claim Ledger execution history.

MABW-080 run registration is experimental experiment metadata tooling. It
registers completed workspace runs into an existing 080 case as `run_record.json`.
MABW-080 scorecard building is experimental deterministic metadata tooling. It
can build a scorecard draft from an existing `run_record.json`, archive/control
projections, target artifacts, and the case definition. The default
`delivery_brief` target keeps the full finalize, reader-clean, and archive
requirements. The `auditable_brief` target is content-level experiment metadata
for frozen audited brief plus auditor gate passage only; it is not a
management-ready delivery claim. Python fills control integrity, fact-layer
match, reader-clean or target-not-required status, gate/finalize/archive,
timing, and coverage-delta status when inputs are available. It does not score guidance
manifestation, summarize experiments, scaffold conditions, run workflow stages,
judge prose quality, or prove output quality.

MABW-080 assessment import is experimental experiment metadata tooling. It
validates externally supplied guidance-manifestation scores, merges them into a
scorecard, and derives the resulting validity class from deterministic control
fields plus the imported assessment method. Python does not judge whether
guidance manifested, whether prose improved, or whether a semantic regression
occurred.

MABW-080 case summarization is experimental experiment metadata tooling. It
aggregates existing scorecards into A/B/invalid counts, condition groups,
manifestation-score counts, reader-clean rates, coverage-delta status, timing
status, and invalid reasons. It discovers scorecards under the case directory
and can include explicit `--scorecard` paths for scorecards written elsewhere.
It does not judge output quality, run workflow stages, scaffold conditions, or
include invalid runs in A-grade denominators.

MABW-080 condition scaffolding is experimental experiment setup tooling. It
requires an initialized condition workspace, imports the frozen fact layer
through the deterministic fast-rerun transaction, writes condition metadata and
operator instructions, and leaves the run at Analyst. It does not create generic
workspace config, run subagents, gates, finalize, register runs, score runs,
summarize cases, or create Improvement Memory.

For the full experimental command sequence and public-claim boundaries, see
[MABW-080 experiment guide](experiments-080.md).
v0.9.1 includes one completed public-safe synthetic `auditable_brief` pilot with
condition-blind, hash-bound assessment. This supports only the documented
single-case observation; broader quality, delivery-readiness, factual
correctness, and generalization claims remain out of scope.

## Runtimes

| Runtime | Status |
|---|---|
| Hermes (`delegate_task` native pipeline + cron) | Supported |
| Claude Code (`/briefloop` and `/mabw` five-verb writer entrypoints + `/generate-brief` compatibility; installable with `multi-agent-brief claude install`) | Supported |
| OpenCode (subagent workflow) | Supported |
| Codex (custom-agent workflow via `runtime install`) | Experimental |
| Manual (print workflow steps) | Supported |

Claude Code is the first-class writer / five-verb path (`new`, `run`, `status`,
`feedback`, `deliver`). Hermes remains a supported delegated/scheduled runtime
path. Codex custom-agent assets are installable into a workspace, but Codex
remains Experimental until a real Codex control-trace smoke validates the
end-to-end specialist workflow. Other runtimes keep their existing workflow
entrypoints.

Runtime source assets under `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`,
and `integrations/hermes-plugin/` are source-clone assets. Package-only installs
ship the CLI, packaged contracts, and packaged eval fixtures, but they do not
ship those source runtime directories as Python package data. Use
`multi-agent-brief runtime install --workspace <workspace> --runtime opencode|claude|codex|all`
from a source clone to copy OpenCode/Claude Code/Codex workspace-local runtime kits.
