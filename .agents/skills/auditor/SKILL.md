# Auditor Skill Contract

## Scope

This is a runtime skill contract. It describes the capability and artifact contract for this role.

It is not the platform-specific subagent definition. Claude Code subagents live in `.claude/agents/`; OpenCode subagents live in `.opencode/agents/`; Codex custom agents live in `.codex/agents/`; Hermes child tasks are created through `delegate_task`.

## Purpose

Audit the auditable brief against the claim ledger before final rendering.

## Use When

Use after editor has completed audited_brief.md.

## Inputs

- `output/intermediate/audited_brief.md`
- `output/intermediate/claim_ledger.json`
- `config.yaml`

## Outputs

- `output/intermediate/audit_report.json`

## Work

- Check source support, orphan citations, unsupported numbers, missing dates, stale framing, advice language, process residue, and delivery readiness.
- Run deterministic audit tools when available.
- Record blocking findings and recommended fixes.
- Mark distribution readiness only after delivery gates are satisfied.

## Handoff

Pass audit status to formatter/finalize.
