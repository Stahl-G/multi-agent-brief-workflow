# MABW-080 Experiment Guide

MABW-080 is an experimental metadata harness for comparing approved guidance
manifestation under the same frozen fact layer.

It is not a production workflow gate, not an LLM judge, and not a proof that
output quality improved. It helps operators prepare comparable condition
workspaces, register completed runs, build deterministic scorecard drafts,
import external assessment, and summarize the resulting metadata.

## Status

MABW-080 commands are **Experimental**. They are intended for controlled
experiment setup and analysis, not for normal brief delivery.

The harness currently supports this command loop:

```text
validate-case
-> scaffold-condition
-> run each condition workspace
-> register-run
-> score-run
-> export-blind-pack
-> import-assessment
-> summarize
```

Python fills deterministic control fields and validates imported assessment
metadata. Python does not decide whether guidance manifested, whether prose got
better, whether a reader would prefer one output, or whether source support is
semantically complete.

## What 080 Measures

080 is for an approved-guidance manifestation question:

```text
Given the same frozen fact layer, did a specific guidance entry manifest in
the selected assessment target for each condition?
```

The current standard conditions are:

| Condition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | Same frozen fact layer, no Improvement Memory and no prompt-only guidance treatment. |
| `memory` | Same frozen fact layer, with operator-prepared approved Improvement Memory matching the guidance set. |
| `prompt_only` | Same frozen fact layer, with the guidance text injected as prompt-only treatment and no Improvement Memory. |

The harness is designed so source-discovery, input governance, Scout, Screener,
and Claim Ledger can be held constant through a frozen fact layer. Downstream
writing and audit still run through normal runtime handoff and completion
transactions.

## Assessment Targets

MABW-080 separates content-level experiment assessment from delivery-level
checks. The default target is `delivery_brief`, so existing cases keep their
current finalize, reader-clean, and archive semantics unless
`case_manifest.json` opts into another target.

| Target | Meaning | Required control surface |
|---|---|---|
| `delivery_brief` | Full reader-delivery target. Guidance is assessed in the finalized reader delivery. | Terminal workflow, run archive, finalize pass, reader-clean delivery, timing, clean/reference-eligible run, same frozen fact layer, and imported assessment. |
| `auditable_brief` | Content-level target for guidance manifestation in `output/intermediate/audited_brief.md`. | Analyst/Editor/Auditor complete, no active repair, clean/reference-eligible run, frozen `audited_brief`, `audit_report`, and auditor gate report hashes, auditor gates pass, timing, same frozen fact layer, and imported assessment. |

Use `auditable_brief` for the minimum A-controlled memory-manifestation
experiment when finalize formatting, DOCX generation, reader-clean delivery, or
delivery archive creation are not the claim being assessed. This target does
not claim management-ready delivery, reader-clean output, DOCX/PDF quality, or
finalize transform correctness.

Example:

```json
{
  "assessment_target": "auditable_brief"
}
```

## What 080 Does Not Prove

Do not use 080 outputs to claim any of the following unless later evidence
actually supports that stronger claim:

- Improvement Memory improves output quality.
- Python judged guidance manifestation.
- An LLM-only assessment is A-grade causal evidence.
- A public-safe skeleton is an A/B result.
- Invalid or contaminated runs count in A-grade denominators.
- A passing scorecard proves semantic source support.
- A faster or cleaner trace proves model performance.

Allowed wording is narrower:

- "These runs used the same frozen fact layer."
- "This scorecard records deterministic control metadata."
- "This assessment was imported from a human or LLM-assisted human review."
- "In this public-safe case, the observed count was `k` out of `n` interpretable scorecards."
- "Invalid runs were excluded from the interpretable metric denominator and retained as failure evidence."

## Case Layout

A case directory contains the experiment contract:

```text
experiments/080/cases/<case_id>/
  case_manifest.json
  frozen_fact_layer.json
  guidance_set.json
  assessments/
    assessment.template.json
```

Common generated outputs may live under the case directory or be passed
explicitly to commands:

```text
run_records/<condition>/<run_id>.run_record.json
scorecards/<condition>/<run_id>.scorecard.json
scorecards/<condition>/<run_id>.assessed_scorecard.json
case_summary.json
```

The exact output layout is operator controlled. `summarize` discovers
scorecards under the case directory and also accepts repeated `--scorecard`
arguments for files written elsewhere.

## Public Pilot Skeleton

The repository includes a public-safe setup fixture:

```text
experiments/080/cases/solar_public_001/
```

It contains a synthetic frozen fact layer seed archive under:

```text
experiments/080/cases/solar_public_001/seed_archive/
```

It is useful for exercising the command loop and public-safety checks. It is
not a completed baseline, memory, or prompt-only condition run, and it does not
contain A/B evidence.

## End-To-End Flow

The examples below use:

```bash
CASE=experiments/080/cases/solar_public_001
ARCHIVE=$CASE/seed_archive/mabw-20260618T000000Z-solarseed0001/manifest.json
```

### 1. Validate The Case

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 validate-case "$CASE"
```

This is read-only. It validates `case_manifest.json`,
`frozen_fact_layer.json`, `guidance_set.json`, and public-safe case boundaries.

### 2. Prepare Initialized Condition Workspaces

`scaffold-condition` requires an initialized workspace. It does not create
generic `config.yaml`, `sources.yaml`, `user.md`, or `audience_profile.md`,
because those files are run direction and must remain controlled across
conditions.

Use a seed/template workspace with the same report objective, audience, source
policy, report date, freshness window, and output style for all conditions:

```bash
multi-agent-brief init ./080-baseline --from-onboarding onboarding.json
multi-agent-brief init ./080-memory --from-onboarding onboarding.json
multi-agent-brief init ./080-prompt-only --from-onboarding onboarding.json
```

For `baseline` and `prompt_only`, the workspace must not contain Improvement
Memory files, snapshots, or runtime handoff residues. For `memory`, the
operator must prepare approved Improvement Memory before running fast-rerun.

### 3. Scaffold Each Condition

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 scaffold-condition \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --condition baseline \
  --workspace ./080-baseline \
  --archive "$ARCHIVE"

multi-agent-brief experiments 080 scaffold-condition \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --condition memory \
  --workspace ./080-memory \
  --archive "$ARCHIVE"

multi-agent-brief experiments 080 scaffold-condition \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --condition prompt_only \
  --workspace ./080-prompt-only \
  --archive "$ARCHIVE"
```

This imports the frozen fact layer through the deterministic fast-rerun
transaction and writes:

```text
experiment/080/condition.json
experiment/080/operator_instructions.md
```

It does not run subagents, gates, finalize, register, score, assess, or
summarize.

### 4. Run Each Condition Workspace

After reading `experiment/080/operator_instructions.md`, run each condition
from Analyst onward:

```bash
multi-agent-brief run --workspace ./080-baseline --recipe fast-rerun --skip-doctor
multi-agent-brief run --workspace ./080-memory --recipe fast-rerun --skip-doctor
multi-agent-brief run --workspace ./080-prompt-only --recipe fast-rerun --skip-doctor
```

Complete the normal downstream workflow for each condition. Source-discovery,
input governance, Scout, Screener, and Claim Ledger are satisfied by import and
must not be replayed for the condition workspace.

### 5. Register Runs

For the default `delivery_brief` target, run registration requires a terminal
completed workspace and an archive under `output/runs/<run_id>/`.

For `auditable_brief`, registration may stop after Auditor completes and the
workflow is ready for Finalize. The run must still be clean/reference-eligible,
have no active repair, preserve the same frozen fact layer, and have valid
frozen hashes for:

```text
output/intermediate/audited_brief.md
output/intermediate/audit_report.json
output/intermediate/gates/auditor_quality_gate_report.json
```

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 register-run \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --condition baseline \
  --workspace ./080-baseline \
  --output "$CASE/run_records/baseline.run_record.json"
```

Repeat for `memory` and `prompt_only`.

Registration writes only the requested `run_record.json`. It does not mutate
the workspace, the case, the archive, the Claim Ledger, or delivery artifacts.
Contaminated completed runs can be registered as failure evidence, but remain
non-reference-eligible.

### 6. Build Deterministic Scorecard Drafts

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 score-run \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --run-record "$CASE/run_records/baseline.run_record.json" \
  --output "$CASE/scorecards/baseline.scorecard.json"
```

Repeat for each condition.

`score-run` projects deterministic fields from the registered run and target:

- control integrity
- frozen fact-layer match
- reader-clean and gate/finalize/archive status when required by target
- timing summary
- coverage-delta status when available
- required guidance entry IDs
- `assessment_status: needs_assessment`

For `auditable_brief`, `reader_clean` and finalize delivery fields are marked
`not_required_for_target`, and the control projection uses the frozen audited
brief, audit report, and auditor gate report recorded by `register-run`.

It does not fill guidance manifestation scores.

### 7. Export A Condition-Blind Assessment Pack

For formal auditable-brief assessment, export a condition-blind, hash-bound
pack after scorecard drafts are ready:

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 export-blind-pack \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/baseline.scorecard.json" \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/memory.scorecard.json" \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/prompt_only.scorecard.json" \
  --output "$CASE/blind_assessment_pack"
```

The scorer-facing `blind_pack.json` and `items/BI-*/audited_brief.md` files
strip condition names, run IDs, local paths, treatment metadata, Improvement
Memory metadata, and prompt-only condition metadata. The shared rubric remains
visible because 080 is condition-blind, not guidance-blind.

The separate `reveal_mapping.json` binds:

```text
blind_item_id -> audited brief sha256 -> scorecard hash -> condition/run identity
```

Do not send the reveal mapping to the assessor. It is used only when importing
the returned assessment so Python can verify the assessed blind artifact hash
before assigning the assessment back to a condition.

### 8. Import External Assessment

Copy the assessment template and replace placeholders with the completed run
identity and reviewer assessment:

```text
experiments/080/cases/solar_public_001/assessments/assessment.template.json
```

Then import it:

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 import-assessment \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/baseline.scorecard.json" \
  --assessment "$CASE/assessments/baseline.assessment.json" \
  --output "$CASE/scorecards/baseline.assessed_scorecard.json"
```

For blind assessment import, the assessment file references `blind_item_id` and
`blind_artifact_sha256` instead of condition/run identity. Import with the blind
pack and reveal mapping:

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 import-assessment \
  --blind-pack "$CASE/blind_assessment_pack/blind_pack.json" \
  --reveal-mapping "$CASE/blind_assessment_pack/reveal_mapping.json" \
  --assessment "$CASE/assessments/BI-A.assessment.json" \
  --output "$CASE/scorecards/BI-A.assessed_scorecard.json"
```

If the blind audited brief was modified after export, import fails closed.

Assessment files may use:

```text
human
llm_assisted_human_review
llm_only
```

`llm_only` assessment can support `B_integration` metadata, but it cannot
promote relevant guidance scores to `A_controlled`.

Guidance scores use:

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | not observed |
| `1` | partially observed or weakly manifested |
| `2` | manifested |
| `3` | overapplied |

`overapplication` must be `true` if and only if `manifestation_score` is `3`.

### 9. Summarize The Case

```bash
multi-agent-brief experiments 080 summarize \
  --case "$CASE" \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/baseline.assessed_scorecard.json" \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/memory.assessed_scorecard.json" \
  --scorecard "$CASE/scorecards/prompt_only.assessed_scorecard.json" \
  --output "$CASE/case_summary.json"
```

`summarize` aggregates existing scorecards only. It does not rerun workflow
stages, score prose, import assessments, or judge quality.

## Interpreting Validity Classes

| Validity class | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| `A_controlled` | Clean, same-fact-layer, reference-eligible run with required control projections and human or LLM-assisted human assessment for relevant guidance. |
| `B_integration` | Interpretable integration observation, often including `llm_only` assessment or non-A-grade control surface. |
| `invalid_contaminated` | Run is useful failure evidence but not reference-eligible. |
| `invalid_incomplete` | Required run, archive, scorecard, or assessment material is missing or incomplete. |
| `invalid_fact_layer_mismatch` | The run did not use the case frozen fact layer. |

Summary output separates:

- `raw_observed_assessments`: imported guidance scores observed in the input
  scorecards, including pilot, invalid, stale, and non-blind observations.
- `valid_interpretable_metrics`: formal metrics whose scorecards pass the
  target contract, audit binding, treatment isolation, and condition-blind
  hash-bound assessment checks.
- `exclusions`: scorecards retained as evidence but excluded from formal
  metrics, with deterministic reasons.
- `hardening_warnings`: warnings such as low formal denominator or missing
  blind assessment binding.

`run_counts.interpretable_run_denominator` is the formal denominator, not the
raw count of `A_controlled + B_integration` labels. Raw validity labels remain
available under `validity_class_counts` for auditability.

`manifestation_score = 3` is overapplication. It is counted separately and must
not be combined with score 2 as a stronger success.

## Common Failure Modes

### `scaffold-condition` Rejects The Workspace

The workspace must already be initialized and must preserve the intended run
direction. Missing `config.yaml`, `sources.yaml`, `user.md`, or
`audience_profile.md` blocks scaffold.

For `baseline` and `prompt_only`, Improvement Memory residues also block
scaffold. Use a clean condition workspace rather than trying to reuse an old
memory-treated workspace.

### `scaffold-condition` Rejects The Archive

The archive fact layer must match `frozen_fact_layer.json`. This prevents a
condition workspace from silently using different evidence.

### `register-run` Rejects The Workspace

Registration requires a terminal completed run with a matching archive manifest
under `output/runs/<run_id>/`. Non-terminal workspaces and run-ID mismatches are
rejected.

### `score-run` Writes `needs_assessment`

That is expected. Scorecard drafts are deterministic metadata. Manifestation
scores enter only through `import-assessment`.

### `summarize` Shows Zero Scorecards

Place scorecards under the case directory or pass each external scorecard with
`--scorecard`. If two external scorecards would collapse to the same display
path, summarize fails closed so the summary remains auditable.

## Public Wording Checklist

Use these patterns:

- "The run was registered under MABW-080."
- "The scorecard reports deterministic control metadata."
- "The assessment was imported from external review."
- "The summary observed `k` raw score-2 assessments and `n` formal interpretable scorecards."
- "Invalid runs were excluded from the interpretable denominator."
- "Non-blind pilot scorecards remained visible as raw observations but were excluded from formal metrics."

Avoid these patterns:

- "MABW proved the guidance improved quality."
- "MABW proved Improvement Memory works."
- "A-controlled effect validated."
- "Memory improves output quality."
- "Prompt-only is worse."
- "Python judged the guidance manifested."
- "The skeleton fixture demonstrates a win."
- "The model performed better."
- "Invalid runs were counted as controlled evidence."

## Current Completion Boundary

As of v0.8.5, MABW has the 080 command loop and pilot-level observation. The
pilot can be interpreted as effect observed, not effect proven.

Formal A-controlled rerun requires v0.8.6 hardening and a fresh 090 experiment.
