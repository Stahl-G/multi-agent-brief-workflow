# Naming And Compatibility

Read this when the task touches BriefLoop/MABW naming, public links, release
notes, or compatibility claims.

## Current Names

- Public project name: BriefLoop
- Historical implementation lineage: MABW
- CLI: `multi-agent-brief`; shell alias: `briefloop`
- Claude command: `/briefloop`; compatibility command: `/mabw`
- Python module: `multi_agent_brief`
- Package/distribution: `multi-agent-brief-workflow`
- Experiment namespace: MABW-080
- Public README bodies:
  - `README.md` is the canonical English README.
  - `README.zh-CN.md` is the canonical Chinese README.
  - `README_en.md` is only a short compatibility pointer to `README.md`.
- Product-facing ReportPack entries:
  - `industry-weekly` -> internal/canonical `market_weekly`
  - `management-monthly` -> internal/canonical `management_monthly`
  - `document-review` -> internal/canonical `evidence_extract`
  - `solar-periodic` -> internal/canonical `solar_industry_periodic`

## Compatibility Rules

- Do not rename runtime surfaces by accident.
- Do not change workspace artifact names for public framing only.
- Do not write product-facing aliases into control artifacts that require
  canonical ids unless the implementation explicitly supports that alias layer.
- When public docs say BriefLoop, keep compatibility notes for
  `multi-agent-brief`, `briefloop`, `/briefloop`, `/mabw`, package/module
  paths, and MABW experiment IDs.
- Keep README canonicalization intact. `README_en.md` should remain a pointer,
  not a third long-form README body.
- BriefLoop-090 can be a future experiment/readiness label; v0.9.0 is a semver
  release. `experiments 090` is not a current CLI namespace. Do not conflate
  them.

## Current Authority

Use `docs/briefloop-naming.md`, `docs/architecture-status.md`, and
`docs/support-matrix.md` for current public compatibility wording.
