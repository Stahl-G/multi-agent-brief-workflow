# Support Matrix

Each capability has one of the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Supported** | Actively tested, documented, and considered stable for v1.0. |
| **Experimental** | Functional but may change without notice. Not guaranteed for production. |
| **Interface Only** | Abstract interface exists; no concrete implementation shipped. |
| **CLI-only** | Installs and exposes deterministic CLI commands, but does not include source-clone runtime asset trees. |
| **Source-clone-only** | Requires repository files that are not shipped as Python package data. |
| **Deprecated** | Still present but scheduled for removal. Use the replacement. |
| **Not shipped** | Not included in this distribution surface. |

For control-surface capabilities, **Supported** means deterministic commands,
contracts, and regression tests are present. It does not imply output-quality
validation unless that is stated separately.

## Core Pipeline

Feedback commands structure issues and repair plans for the Orchestrator. They do not automatically edit brief artifacts or execute repair.

Quality gate commands write deterministic gate reports and can block unsafe current-stage continue/finalize decisions. They include material-fact, freshness, target-relevance, and editor-new-fact checks. They do not fetch sources, rewrite briefs, execute repair, or create feedback issues automatically.

Evaluation cases are developer/CI regression checks for control-surface behavior. They do not create workflow artifacts, run subagents, fetch sources, score prose, call an LLM judge, or execute repair.

Provenance commands write a deterministic workspace-local audit/debug graph from existing control files. They do not fetch sources, execute workflow stages, replay the runtime, execute repair, verify semantic truth, or block `finalize` by default.

Audience profile files are workspace-local runtime context. The active run uses the frozen per-run snapshot exposed through handoff; these files are not source evidence, artifact contracts, quality gates, provenance graph nodes, or stage blockers.

Improvement Ledger files are human-governed workspace memory controls. Approved materializable guidance is projected into `improvement/memory.md` and frozen into `output/intermediate/improvement_memory_snapshot.md` during `run`/`start`/`handoff`. The snapshot is taste/audience guidance only; it is not evidence, source material, Claim Ledger input, repair instruction, semantic proof, or an output-quality guarantee.

Control switchboard files are runtime control context. Python surfaces deterministic recommendations and records Orchestrator enable/defer/reject selections; selection is not execution and does not run gates, feedback planning, provenance projection, source discovery, repair, or subagents.

Role topology controls runtime role assignment, not the accountable artifact set.
The default topology lets Scout write both `candidate_claims.json` and
`screened_candidates.json`; strict topology keeps Screener independent. Both
paths still require the Claim Ledger, auditable draft, stage-scoped gate
reports, audit report, event log, archive, and human-triggered delivery. This is
not a speed-improvement claim.

Claim Ledger freeze is a deterministic control transaction. Claim Ledger agents
write `claim_drafts.json` without claim IDs; Python assigns deterministic
`CL-####` IDs, writes the canonical `claim_ledger.json`, records freeze
metadata, and requires the frozen ledger before Claim Ledger stage completion.
This controls identity and freezing; it is not semantic proof or automatic claim
deduplication.

Source appendices are reader-facing delivery artifacts generated during finalize from cited Claim Ledger sources. They are not source evidence, semantic proof, runtime state, provenance graphs, or workflow gates.

Fast-rerun fact-layer import is an experimental control transaction. It can
import a complete, clean, archived frozen fact layer into a new runtime run for
downstream rerun inspection. It does not register 080 experiment runs, score
output quality, summarize experiments, scaffold conditions, or prove semantic
truth. `run --recipe fast-rerun` requires an existing valid
`runtime_manifest.fact_layer_import`; it writes runtime handoff guidance from
Analyst onward and must not synthesize upstream source-discovery, Scout,
Screener, or Claim Ledger execution history.

MABW-080 run registration is experimental experiment metadata tooling. It
registers completed workspace runs into an existing 080 case as `run_record.json`.
It does not score guidance manifestation, summarize experiments, scaffold
conditions, run workflow stages, or prove output quality.

## Runtimes

| Runtime | Status |
|---|---|
| Hermes (`delegate_task` native pipeline + cron) | Supported |
| Claude Code (`/mabw` five-verb writer entrypoint + `/generate-brief` compatibility; installable with `multi-agent-brief claude install`) | Supported |
| OpenCode (subagent workflow) | Supported |
| Codex (custom-agent workflow via `runtime install`) | Experimental |
| Manual (print workflow steps) | Supported |

Claude Code is the first-class writer / five-verb path (`new`, `run`, `status`,
`feedback`, `deliver`). Hermes remains a supported delegated/scheduled runtime
path. Codex custom-agent assets are installable into a workspace, but Codex
remains Experimental until a real Codex control-trace smoke validates the
end-to-end specialist workflow. Other runtimes keep their existing workflow
entrypoints.

Runtime source assets under `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`,
and `integrations/hermes-plugin/` are source-clone assets. Package-only installs
ship the CLI, packaged contracts, and packaged eval fixtures, but they do not
ship those source runtime directories as Python package data. Use
`multi-agent-brief runtime install --workspace <workspace> --runtime opencode|claude|codex|all`
from a source clone to copy OpenCode/Claude Code/Codex workspace-local runtime kits.
