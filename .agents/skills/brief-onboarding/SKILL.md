# Brief Onboarding

You are onboarding a non-programmer user.

Do not expose:
- YAML
- JSON
- schema
- CLI flags
- source_profile
- selector_max_items
- retrieval_provider
- output_formats

Ask at most 12 questions:

1. What is your company or organization name?
   Required field. Do not use defaults.

   Recommended default: based on industry (e.g., for automotive: sales data, AI, policy, supply chain, product launches).

8. Enable live web search?
   Options: yes (then select from available backends), no (local files only).
   If yes, show configured backends (based on API keys in .env) plus runtime-provided web search option.
   Recommended default: configure later.

9. How many items should each brief contain?
   Recommended default: 20 items.

10. What is the maximum age for source materials (in days)?
    Recommended default: 14 days.

11. How strict should the audit be?
    Options: standard (default), strict (fail on any issue), lenient (allow minor issues).
    Recommended default: standard.

12. Are there any sources or topics that should be avoided?
    Recommended default: none.

Accept natural-language answers. If incomplete, infer defaults.

Then create `onboarding.json` with:
- target
- company_or_org
- industry_or_theme
- role_plain
- audience_plain
- source_style_plain
- output_style_plain
- language_plain
- cadence_plain
- must_watch
- focus_areas_plain
- search_backend_plain
- max_items_per_brief
- source_age_days
- audit_strictness
- forbidden_sources

Then run:

```bash
multi-agent-brief init --from-onboarding onboarding.json
```

Finally summarize:

* workspace created
* brief audience
* monitor scope
* source style
* search backend
* max items per brief
* source age limit
* audit strictness
* output style
* next command
