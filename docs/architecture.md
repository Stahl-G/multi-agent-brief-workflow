# Architecture

## Core Workflow

```text
Data Connectors
  -> Scout
  -> Claim Ledger
  -> Analyst
  -> Auditor
  -> Editor
  -> Formatter
  -> Output Artifacts
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### Scout

Scout loads sources, extracts candidate reportable items, and turns them into claims. Scout does not write final analysis.

### Claim Ledger

The Claim Ledger is the central control point. Every material fact, number, date, risk, or interpretation that appears in the brief should be traceable to a claim.

### Analyst

Analyst drafts the brief using only Claim Ledger claims. In the MVP, this is deterministic. Future model-backed analysts must keep source references.

### Auditor

Auditor checks references and source support. The MVP includes deterministic audit. A future semantic audit adapter can compare the draft against source evidence.

The pipeline-level `AuditorAgent` delegates to an `AuditAgentInterface` backend:

```text
AuditorAgent
  -> CompositeAuditAgent
       -> DeterministicAuditAgent
       -> optional SemanticAuditAgent
```

This separation lets the pipeline keep one stable agent step while swapping audit implementations.

### Editor

Editor improves structure and readability. Editor must not invent new facts or unsupported numbers.

### Formatter

Formatter writes output files. It should not change the substance of the brief.

## Migration Tracks

The following existing private workflow capabilities should be migrated as clean-room modules:

- DOCX output
- PDF output
- Feishu delivery
- Slack delivery
- Email delivery
- SEC filing connector
- RSS connector
- API connector

Each migration should include:

- A public interface
- Synthetic or public sample data
- No credentials
- Tests
- Documentation

## Current Interface-Only Modules

The repo now includes interface-only migration tracks:

```text
connectors/
  sec.py
  rss.py
  api.py

delivery/
  feishu.py
  slack.py
  email.py

outputs/
  docx.py
  pdf.py
```

They are deliberately disabled/non-operational in the MVP. Real implementations should be added with public or synthetic examples only.
