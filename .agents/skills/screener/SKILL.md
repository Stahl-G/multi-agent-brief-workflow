# Screener Skill

## Purpose

Filters, ranks, deduplicates, freshness-checks, and capacity-caps Scout candidates before Claim Ledger.

## When To Use

Use when implementing or reviewing novelty scoring, source-tier ranking, topic caps, stale source filtering, or previous-report deduplication.

## Responsibilities

- Filter and rank Scout candidates.
- Deduplicate exact and near-duplicate items.
- Enforce topic capacity caps.
- Detect previous-report overlap.
- Exclude stale or low-confidence candidates according to config.
- Preserve source identity and evidence for included candidates.
- Record exclusion reasons when practical.

## Guardrails

- Screen existing Scout candidates only.
- Apply reporting-window freshness rules from config.
- Preserve source identity for every included item.
- Apply configured topic capacity caps.

## Subagent workflow Context
