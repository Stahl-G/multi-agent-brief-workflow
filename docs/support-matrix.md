# Support Matrix

Each capability has one of the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Supported** | Actively tested, documented, and considered stable for v1.0. |
| **Experimental** | Functional but may change without notice. Not guaranteed for production. |
| **Interface Only** | Abstract interface exists; no concrete implementation shipped. |
| **CLI-only** | Requires source clone + manual setup; not available via pip install. |
| **Deprecated** | Still present but scheduled for removal. Use the replacement. |

## Core Pipeline

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Subagent workflow (Scout → Screener → Claim Ledger → Analyst → Editor → Auditor) | Supported |
| Runtime handoff (`agent_handoff.md` + `agent_handoff.json`) | Supported |
| Runtime state control files (`runtime_manifest.json`, `workflow_state.json`, `artifact_registry.json`, `event_log.jsonl`) | Supported |
| Audience profile runtime surface (`audience_profile.md` + `audience_profile_snapshot.md`) | Supported |
| Orchestrator control switchboard (`orchestrator_control_switchboard.json`, optional `control_selections.json`) | Supported |
| Feedback control files (`feedback_issues.json`, `repair_plan.json`, conditional `delta_audit_report.json`) | Supported |
| Quality gate control file (`quality_gate_report.json`) | Supported |
| Provenance projection control file (`provenance_graph.json`) | Supported |
| Finalize (Markdown + DOCX) | Supported |

Feedback commands structure issues and repair plans for the Orchestrator. They do not automatically edit brief artifacts or execute repair.

Quality gate commands write deterministic gate reports and can block unsafe current-stage continue/finalize decisions. They do not fetch sources, rewrite briefs, execute repair, or create feedback issues automatically.

Evaluation cases are developer/CI regression checks for control-surface behavior. They do not create workflow artifacts, run subagents, fetch sources, score prose, call an LLM judge, or execute repair.

Provenance commands write a deterministic workspace-local audit/debug graph from existing control files. They do not fetch sources, execute workflow stages, replay the runtime, execute repair, verify semantic truth, or block `finalize` by default.

Audience profile files are workspace-local runtime context. The active run uses the frozen per-run snapshot exposed through handoff; these files are not source evidence, artifact contracts, quality gates, provenance graph nodes, or stage blockers.

Control switchboard files are runtime control context. Python surfaces deterministic recommendations and records Orchestrator enable/defer/reject selections; selection is not execution and does not run gates, feedback planning, provenance projection, source discovery, repair, or subagents.
