# Final Quality Harness Skill

## Purpose

Reviews and implements final text delivery gates for BRIEF_HARNESS_V2 final target.

## When To Use

Use when working on FinalQualityAuditAgent, final Markdown quality gates, report depth, metadata, summary bullet separation, stale-current framing, or publication readiness.

## Responsibilities

- Validate final report depth unless quiet_week is explicit.
- Validate front-page metadata when configured.
- Validate executive summary bullet separation.
- Block stale-current framing.
- Block internal workflow residue.
- Keep final gate separate from default MVP draft audit.

## Hard Rules

- Do not let correct facts pass if final text quality is blocked.
- Do not invent facts while repairing final prose.
- Do not remove safety notes to pass formatting.

## Pipeline Context

```text
Scout -> Screener -> Claim Ledger -> Analyst -> Editor -> Auditor -> Formatter
```

## Expected Inputs

Source files, claim ledger entries, or draft markdown as appropriate for the harness stage.

## Expected Outputs

Structured artifacts conforming to the pipeline contract:
- `draft_brief.md`
- `claim_ledger.json`
- `audit_report.json`
- `source_map.md`
