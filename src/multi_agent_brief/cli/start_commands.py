"""start / handoff — unified launcher that hands off to the agent runtime.

start never generates a brief; it never calls BriefPipeline or prepare.
It handles workspace init/doctor and produces a runtime handoff artifact
so the user's current agent (Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or
manual) can continue from a known state.
