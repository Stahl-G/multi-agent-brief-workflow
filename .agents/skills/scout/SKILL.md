# Scout Skill Contract

## Scope

This is a runtime skill contract. It describes the capability and artifact contract for this role.

It is not the platform-specific subagent definition. Claude Code subagents live in `.claude/agents/`; OpenCode subagents live in `.opencode/agents/`; Codex custom agents live in `.codex/agents/`; Hermes child tasks are created through `delegate_task`.

## Purpose

Extract source-grounded candidate reportable items from approved evidence inputs.

## Use When

Use after source discovery, doctor, and input governance have identified evidence material for a workspace.

## Inputs

- `config.yaml`
- `sources.yaml`
- `user.md`
- `input/`
- `input/hermes_cache/ when present`
- approved source packages or evidence input lists

## Outputs

- `output/intermediate/candidate_claims.json`

## Work

- Read approved source files, cached source packages, and evidence input lists.
- Extract candidate reportable items with source identity, evidence text, source date, topic, claim type, and confidence.
- Mark vague, stale-looking, duplicate-looking, or low-confidence candidates.
- Keep source wording and evidence traceable.
- Return candidates, not final analysis.

## Handoff

Pass candidate_claims.json to screener.
