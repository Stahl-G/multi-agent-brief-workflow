# BriefLoop Operator Skill Changelog

## briefloop-operator-skill-v0.1.2 — 2026-06-30

- Added Quality Panel / Quality Summary / static HTML operator guidance,
  including `briefloop quality summarize`, SHA-bound summary/HTML projections,
  and audit-bundle-only boundaries.
- Added internal release-mode approval guidance for `approval init`,
  `approval record`, `release check`, event-log linkage, and the distinction
  between internal readiness and public release authority.
- Added v0.11 product-baseline readiness checks to the repo-development
  validation checklist.
- Documented product-facing ReportPack entry aliases while preserving canonical
  internal pack ids in control artifacts.
- Documented README canonicalization: `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` are the
  long-form public README bodies; `README_en.md` is a compatibility pointer.
- Added new Python-owned projection/control artifacts to the control-record map:
  `quality_panel.json`, `quality_summary.md`, `quality_panel.html`,
  `human_approval_ledger.json`, and `release_readiness_report.json`.
