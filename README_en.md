</p>

A source-grounded, audit-ready multi-agent workflow for producing business, research, market, policy, and management briefs.

> Let code do lookup. Let models do judgment. Keep every important claim traceable.

This project turns the repeatable briefing workflow used by analysts, strategy teams, investor relations teams, research desks, and management offices into a transparent Python pipeline:

```text
Scout -> Screener -> Claim Ledger -> Analyst -> Auditor -> Editor -> Formatter
```

It is not an investment advice tool, trading signal generator, or replacement for human review.

## What Problem This Solves

Most weekly reports and executive briefs still depend on a fragile manual process: collect information, decide what matters, write analysis, verify facts, edit wording, and format the final file. That process is easy to rush, hard to audit, and difficult to reuse across teams.

This repo makes the workflow modular, inspectable, and runnable locally:

- Source-backed statements are written into a Claim Ledger before they enter the brief.
- Drafts use explicit `[src:CLAIM_ID]` citations.
- Auditors can check unsupported numbers, stale sources, duplicate claims, placeholders, and redaction risks.
- Output artifacts keep the brief, audit report, claim ledger, and source map separate.

## Project Motivation

This project is an open-source workflow for producing leadership briefs, weekly reports, research notes, market updates, and policy briefings used in corporate strategy teams, securities research, funds, investor relations, management offices, and research desks.

In many organizations, interns, management trainees, and junior analysts spend a large amount of time preparing daily, weekly, and monthly reports. The work is important, but the process is often repetitive: collecting sources, filtering what matters, removing stale or duplicate signals, drafting analysis, checking facts, editing wording, and formatting the final document.

This project turns that workflow into a source-grounded, audit-ready, multi-agent pipeline:

```text
Source Providers -> Scout -> Screener -> Claim Ledger -> Analyst -> Auditor -> Editor -> Formatter
```

It does not replace human judgment and does not provide investment advice. Instead, it helps structure repetitive briefing work so people can spend more time on analysis, discussion, and decision support.

The core principle is:

> Let code do lookup. Let models do judgment. Keep every important claim traceable.

## Why Multi-Agent Instead Of One Prompt

A real briefing process is not one job. It is a small editorial desk:

- Scout finds reportable signals.
- Screener filters and ranks candidates by novelty, source tier, and topic capacity.
- Claim Ledger records evidence.
- Analyst turns evidence into a structured draft.
- Auditor checks whether the draft is supported and distribution-ready.
- Editor improves readability without inventing new facts.
- Formatter writes the final artifacts.

Splitting these roles reduces hidden reasoning shortcuts. Each step has a narrow responsibility, and the audit trail shows where a claim came from before it reaches the final brief.

## Current MVP

The first local MVP supports:

- Local `.md`, `.txt`, and `.json` inputs
- Scout agent that extracts candidate reportable items
- Screener agent that filters claims by novelty scoring, topic capacity caps, and previous-report deduplication
- Claim Ledger with source-grounded claims
- Analyst agent that drafts a Markdown brief with `[src:CLAIM_ID]` citations
- Auditor agent interface with deterministic audit and semantic-audit adapter hooks
- Deterministic Auditor for missing claims, unsupported numbers, duplicate claims, redaction risks, and stale sources
- Quality harness checks for placeholders, low-confidence sources, process residue, stale filler, and unit risks
- Editor agent that prepares the final Markdown brief
- Formatter agent that writes `brief.md`, `claim_ledger.json`, `audit_report.json`, and `source_map.md`

## Example Output

The MVP creates a Markdown brief with source citations:

```markdown
## Market

- Synthetic module price checks showed a 3.5% week-over-week decline in selected spot-market channels. [src:MARKETDA_867A7D67D0]
```

Every source-backed statement is also written to `claim_ledger.json`:

```json
{
  "claim_id": "MARKETDA_867A7D67D0",
  "statement": "Synthetic module price checks showed a 3.5% week-over-week decline in selected spot-market channels.",
  "source_id": "MARKET_DATA",
  "evidence_text": "Synthetic module price checks showed a 3.5% week-over-week decline in selected spot-market channels."
}
```

The audit report records whether the draft is distribution-ready:

```json
{
  "audit_status": "pass",
  "audit_score": 100,
  "findings": []
}
```

## Quick Start

macOS / Linux / WSL:

```bash
cd multi-agent-brief-workflow
bash scripts/setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
multi-agent-brief run examples/basic_market_brief/input --output output/basic_market_brief
```

Windows 10/11 should use native PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7. WSL/Git Bash is optional, not required. CMD is not the primary support target.

```powershell
cd multi-agent-brief-workflow
.\scripts\setup.ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
multi-agent-brief version
multi-agent-brief run examples/basic_market_brief/input --output output/basic_market_brief
```

Or run from a config file:

```bash
multi-agent-brief run --config examples/basic_market_brief/config.yaml
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
multi-agent-brief run --config examples/basic_market_brief/config.yaml
```

The example config enables a strict weekly reporting window:

```yaml
report:
  date: "2026-06-02"
  max_source_age_days: 14
  fail_on_stale_source: true
```

When this mode is enabled, a three-month-old source cannot pass as a weekly item.

Open the generated files:

```text
output/basic_market_brief/brief.md
output/basic_market_brief/claim_ledger.json
output/basic_market_brief/audit_report.json
output/basic_market_brief/source_map.md
```

## More Examples

Run the synthetic earnings-season peer demo:

```bash
multi-agent-brief run --config examples/earnings_season_peer_demo/config.yaml
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
multi-agent-brief run --config examples/earnings_season_peer_demo/config.yaml
```

This demo uses only fictional peer names and synthetic source data. It is designed to show how public-safe earnings, competitor, policy, and market signals flow through the Claim Ledger and audit report.

## Example Without Install

macOS / Linux / WSL:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m multi_agent_brief.cli.main run examples/basic_market_brief/input --output output/basic_market_brief
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
python -m multi_agent_brief.cli.main run examples/basic_market_brief/input --output output/basic_market_brief
Remove-Item Env:PYTHONPATH
```

## CLI

Create a synthetic demo workspace:

```bash
multi-agent-brief init --demo
multi-agent-brief run --config brief-demo/config.yaml
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
multi-agent-brief init --demo
multi-agent-brief run --config brief-demo/config.yaml
```

Audit an existing brief:

```bash
multi-agent-brief audit output/basic_market_brief/brief.md \
  --ledger output/basic_market_brief/claim_ledger.json \
  --output output/basic_market_brief/audit_report.json
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
multi-agent-brief audit output/basic_market_brief/brief.md `
  --ledger output/basic_market_brief/claim_ledger.json `
  --output output/basic_market_brief/audit_report.json
```

Print the version:

```bash
multi-agent-brief version
```

## Auditor Agent Interface

The pipeline-level `AuditorAgent` delegates to an audit backend that implements `AuditAgentInterface`.

Current audit backends:

- `DeterministicAuditAgent`: checks source IDs, unsupported numbers, duplicate claims, missing source evidence, redaction risks, and reporting-window freshness.
- `QualityHarnessAuditAgent`: ports public-safe quality gates from local workflow prototypes, including placeholders, internal process residue, `needs_recrawl`, low source density, and possible unit inflation.
- `NoOpSemanticAuditAgent`: placeholder adapter for future model-backed semantic source-support review.
- `CompositeAuditAgent`: runs deterministic audit first, then an optional semantic audit adapter.

This keeps the MVP runnable without API keys while leaving a clean interface for Claude, OpenAI, LiteLLM, or local-model audit agents.

See [docs/harness.md](docs/harness.md) for the current harness and migration backlog.

For strict final-delivery gates, see [docs/harness_matrix.md](docs/harness_matrix.md). For Codex, Claude Code subagent, and external-agent handoff patterns, see [docs/agent-collaboration.md](docs/agent-collaboration.md).

## Agent Support

This repository can generate Codex and Claude Code agent configurations from a single role manifest.

- `configs/agent_roles.yaml` is the source of truth.
- `scripts/generate_agent_configs.py` generates platform-specific files.
- `AGENTS.md` provides project-level instructions for Codex and other coding agents.
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` provides Codex-compatible skills.
- `.codex/agents/*.toml` provides Codex custom agents.
- `.claude/agents/*.md` provides Claude Code subagents.
- `docs/agents/` documents platform adaptation and harness subagents.

Regenerate configs:

```bash
python scripts/generate_agent_configs.py --write
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
python scripts/generate_agent_configs.py --write
```

Check generated files:

```bash
python scripts/generate_agent_configs.py --check
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
python scripts/generate_agent_configs.py --check
```

See [docs/windows-powershell.md](docs/windows-powershell.md) for native Windows setup. WSL is optional, not required.

## Safety And Non-Investment-Advice Disclaimer

Do not commit credentials, tokens, webhooks, raw internal logs, private reports, customer names, confidential files, internal paths, or company-specific prompts. All examples in this repo should use public or synthetic data.

This project can help structure research and briefing workflows, but it does not provide legal, financial, investment, trading, or compliance advice. Human review remains required before any real-world distribution or decision-making use.

## Changelog

### v0.5.1 — Source Provider Pipeline Fixes

- Fixed ScoutAgent unconditionally overwriting context.sources: when the pipeline has already collected sources via providers, Scout now uses them directly instead of falling back to local files.
- Fixed AnalystAgent only rendering 5 topics: expanded to all 10 Screener topics (added compliance, demand, rates, capital, technology); unknown topics are also appended.
- Fixed merge_candidates_to_sources() auto-enabling web_search: merge no longer implicitly enables web_search, preventing mock search results from leaking into real reports.
- Fixed WebSearchProvider using hash() for unstable source_id generation: switched to hashlib.sha1 for cross-process consistency.
- Fixed Manual URL placeholders entering Claim Ledger: placeholder sources now carry requires_fetch metadata and Scout skips them automatically.
- Fixed collect_all_sources() silently swallowing provider exceptions: errors are now captured in a returned errors list and included in pipeline artifacts as collection_errors.
- Added 10 new tests covering all fixes.

### v0.5.0 — Three-Layer Source Collection Architecture

- Added `SourcePlanner`: generates search plans based on industry, role, and time window.
- Added `industry_packs.py`: industry presets (solar, technology, finance, etc.) with RSS feeds and search tasks.
- `WebSearchProvider` upgraded from stub to real implementation with pluggable backends (mock, tavily, serpapi).
- Added `CachedPackageProvider`: reads pre-collected source package folders (supports OpenClaw-style workflows).
- Added `search_backends/` module: SearchBackend ABC + MockSearchBackend.
- Unified SourceItem: eliminated duplicate definitions in `core/schemas.py` and `sources/base.py`.
- Pipeline restructured: Source Collection → Scout → Screener → ..., Scout now reads from Provider system.
- CLI gained `--industry` and `--days` args for industry-aware automatic collection.
- Backward compatible: without source_config, still reads local files from input_dir.
- 14 new tests covering SourcePlanner, industry packs, WebSearch, CachedPackage, Pipeline integration.

### v0.4.0 — Source Provider System

- Added `sources/` module: unified SourceProvider interface for all information sources.
- Three source profiles: conservative, research, aggressive_signal.
- Manual provider: loads local .md/.txt/.json files and manual URL entries.
- RSS provider: fetches and parses RSS/Atom feeds with keyword filtering.
- Stub providers for web_search, api, mcp, cli (Phase 1 placeholders).
- Source normalization, deduplication, and recency filtering.
- `multi-agent-brief doctor`: checks source configuration health.
- Init wizard now asks for source profile and generates tailored `sources.yaml`.
- 21 new tests covering providers, normalizer, registry, and doctor.

### v0.3.0 — Agent Config Generation

- Added `configs/agent_roles.yaml` as single source of truth for all agent roles.
- Added `scripts/generate_agent_configs.py` to generate platform-specific agent configs.
- Generated Codex agents (`.codex/agents/*.toml`), skills (`.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`).
- Generated Claude Code subagents (`.claude/agents/*.md`).
- Generated documentation (`docs/agents/`).
- Added 25 tests for manifest validation, generation, and content checks.
- `--check` mode for CI staleness detection.

### v0.2.0 — Screener Agent

- Added ScreenerAgent between Scout and Analyst in the pipeline.
- Topic-based capacity caps across 10 topic buckets (max 160 claims total).
- Novelty scoring with source tier, claim type, and high-signal term weights.
- Previous report deduplication via text matching and theme-group detection.
- Stale source and low-confidence (T5) source exclusion.
- Previous report loader supporting `.md`, `.txt`, and `.docx` formats.
- Added pre-push hook and CI check: README must be updated before pushing code changes.
