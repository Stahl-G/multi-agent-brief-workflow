# Source Planner Skill Contract

## Scope

This is a runtime skill contract. It describes the capability and artifact contract for this role.

It is not the platform-specific subagent definition. Claude Code subagents live in `.claude/agents/`; OpenCode subagents live in `.opencode/agents/`; Codex custom agents live in `.codex/agents/`; Hermes child tasks are created through `delegate_task`.

## Purpose

Plan public, citable source discovery for a workspace.

## Use When

Use when sources.yaml uses llm_decide, or when the workspace needs source candidates or search tasks.

## Inputs

- `user.md`
- `config.yaml`
- `sources.yaml`

## Outputs

- `source_candidates.yaml`
- search tasks or source-discovery notes as configured

## Work

- Understand company, industry, audience, cadence, focus areas, and source preference.
- Propose public, citable, timestamped sources.
- Align sources with selected source profile and runtime search mode.
- Prepare candidates for review and merge.

## Handoff

After source candidates are reviewed and merged, pass source configuration to doctor/source-provider.
