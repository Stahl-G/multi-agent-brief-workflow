# Multi-Agent Brief Workflow for Hermes

## Scope

This skill is the Hermes runtime contract for MABW. It applies when Hermes is asked to set up, schedule, or run a MABW workspace.

The Hermes parent agent is the Orchestrator main agent. It reads shared contract references and runtime state files, controls delegated stages, checks expected artifacts, and selects the next workflow decision.

Contract references:

- `configs/orchestrator_contract.yaml`
- `configs/stage_specs.yaml`
- `configs/artifact_contracts.yaml`
- `configs/policy_packs/default.yaml`

Runtime state files:

- `output/intermediate/runtime_manifest.json`
- `output/intermediate/workflow_state.json`
- `output/intermediate/artifact_registry.json`
- `output/intermediate/event_log.jsonl`

Orchestrator control loop:

```text
Read workspace context -> read contract references -> identify the next stage -> delegate a specialist or Python tool -> check the expected artifact -> decide continue / retry_stage / delegate_repair / request_human_review / block_run / finalize.
```

## Use When

Use this skill when the user asks Hermes to:

- create or continue a MABW brief workspace
- generate a management, market, policy, competitor, or research brief
- schedule daily source cache collection or weekly/monthly brief generation

## Preferred Path: Hermes Plugin

Install and enable the MABW Hermes plugin, then use the plugin tools in Hermes:

```text
/mabw <workspace>
→ mabw_create_onboarding
→ mabw_init_workspace
→ mabw_run_handoff
→ read agent_handoff.md
→ continue delegated workflow
```

Install:

```bash
cp -R integrations/hermes-plugin/mabw ~/.hermes/plugins/mabw
hermes plugins enable mabw
```

The plugin's `references/onboarding-json.md` has the detailed JSON shape and field notes.

## Fallback Path: chat-to-JSON Onboarding

When the plugin is not available, run onboarding as a chat-to-JSON workflow:

1. Collect brief profile in chat — ask for company, industry, task objective, audience, language, cadence, source style, output style, must-watch topics, excluded sources, and source/search mode. Accept natural-language answers and confirm defaults.
2. Write `onboarding.json` from the collected answers.
3. Validate: `multi-agent-brief onboard --validate onboarding.json`
4. Create the workspace: `multi-agent-brief init <workspace> --from-onboarding onboarding.json`
5. Create runtime handoff: `multi-agent-brief run --workspace <workspace>`
6. Read `agent_handoff.md`, `workflow_state.json`, and `artifact_registry.json`, then continue with the delegated workflow below.

## Existing Workspace Path

For a workspace that already has `config.yaml`:

```bash
multi-agent-brief doctor --config <workspace>/config.yaml
multi-agent-brief hermes prompt --config <workspace>/config.yaml
```

## Delegated Brief Run

```text
doctor
→ source discovery when configured
→ input governance
→ delegate_task scout
→ delegate_task screener
→ delegate_task claim-ledger
→ delegate_task analyst
→ delegate_task editor
→ delegate_task auditor
→ finalize
```

Read `references/delegate-task-sequence.md` before creating child tasks.

## Daily Source Cache

Daily cache mode collects source signals and writes cache files without drafting a final brief.

Read `references/source-cache-contract.md` before writing cache files.

## Cron Scheduling

Use cron for durable scheduling and `delegate_task` for per-run child work.

Read `references/cron-patterns.md` before creating or editing Hermes cron jobs.

## Reporting

After a delegated run, report:

- `output/brief.md`
- configured named Markdown copy when enabled
- `output/brief.docx` when configured
- `output/intermediate/audited_brief.md`
- `output/intermediate/claim_ledger.json`
- `output/intermediate/audit_report.json`
- audit status and remaining limitations
